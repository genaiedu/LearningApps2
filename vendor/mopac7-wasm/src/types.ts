 * MOPAC 7's molecular-mechanics correction to the peptide (`-HNCO-`) torsion,

 *
 * `moldat.f` searches the geometry for `H-N-C=O` groups and **stops** on the
 * first one it finds unless the deck names one of these two, so every deck this
 * package builds carries one.
 *
 * - `'mmok'` writes `MMOK`, which adds `HTYPE * sin²(H-N-C=O)` per torsion to
 *   the heat of formation and to the Cartesian gradient (`compfg.f`,
 *   `dcart.f`), with `HTYPE` 6.1737 kcal/mol for MNDO, 3.3191 for AM1, 7.1853
 *   for PM3 and 1.7712 for MINDO/3. It is zero for a planar amide and largest
 *   for a twisted one, which is the rotation barrier NDDO underestimates.
 * - `'nomm'` writes `NOMM`, which leaves the heat of formation alone.
 *
 * The term is added **after** the SCF and never enters the Fock matrix, so the
 * choice moves {@link Mopac7Result.heatOfFormation} and nothing else: over
 * formamide, acetamide, N-methylacetamide, glycylglycine and benzene at AM1,
 * every orbital energy, every coefficient and every Mulliken charge comes back
 * identical under the two.
